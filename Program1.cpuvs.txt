LOD #10 ; Load 10 into the accumulator
MUL #2 ; Multiply accumulator by 2 (10 * 2 = 20)
SUB #5 ; Subtract 5 from accumulator (20 - 5 = 15)
STO 50 ; Store result (15) in memory location 50
CMP #0 ; Compare ACC with 0 (sets flags, but ACC remains unchanged)
JZ 8 ; If ACC is 0, jump to instruction 8 (skip the next step)
HLT ; Halt execution (if jump was not taken)
HLT ; Halt execution (if jump was taken)
